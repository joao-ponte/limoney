# Limoney

Welcome to Limoney, the ultimate game app for young entrepreneurs aged 10 to 14 who are eager to learn about business and finance through a fun and interactive experience.

## Overview

Limoney transforms the traditional lemonade stand into an engaging learning platform where users can manage inventory, make strategic investments and enhance their business operations. This app is designed to teach essential skills like budgeting and money management in a playful and educational way. We created Limoney because we believe these skills are crucial for children's development and are often overlooked in traditional education.
